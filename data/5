why the tentacles of the weinstein effect reach for those in power 
updated november 
wave of sexual assault and harassment allegations is crashing across the reaching into an increasing number of industries with claims men are abusing positions of 
new york times published the article weinstein paid off sexual harassment accusers for on october 
men at the height of several industries have faced sexual assault or harassment 
are no geographical boundaries to this surge in allegations 
a snapshot of our coverage to date in november stories on claims and cases of sexual assault and as well as women speaking out against violence have 
to an austrian politician resigning amid sexual harassment out your similar social media trends in italy and spain as well as the countless stories told around the world that had mentions of on twitter doing 
keltner is a professor of psychology at university of berkeley and has spent years studying 
said the weinstein case together every force that makes power 
is striking to just think about the context that per cent of directors in hollywood are professor keltner 
you have a kind of concentration of a certain type of so men or a certain more likely to get an abuse of power against another group like young 
keltner has been watching with great interest as the weinstein case unfolds and the world wakes 
think this is a pivotal i really he 
started to wonder if there was a genuine and enduring shift 
this different to bill is this different to that time a recording of a presidential candidate saying he grabbed women the was released during a campaign and he got elected 
have been writing about social scientists have been studying sexual women have been talking about it among but sometimes you need these moral events where suddenly got to change 
think this is 
theory is that this time have allies and taking control of the 
new york times journalists who fought for more than a decade to get the weinstein story pressed publish at a time when movements like march had made significant 
there is a network of people men and women who are getting strength from one another to say harassment from cat calling on the street to assault as invasive as rape is not ok and will no longer be 
keltner talked about a group of female leaders who run sections of the us healthcare 
they is what women will now be doing he 
are things a man cannot do to and if he does you get to tell 
whistle at he roll his eyes when in a he grab your body or try to kiss you he just do 
media coverage has activists and victims have found a very specific 
you gather you allow people to use this professor keltner 
allow people to senior male professor grabbed my and we were hesitant to use that language and so we get a clear picture of this phenomenon and different 
own that language and when you do that you empower 
when donald trump called hillary clinton a 
term activists took ownership of 
cut to claw back professor keltner got to take on the grittiness of 
are gaining power right now more than had in 
sex discrimination kate agrees the time is 
really hopeful and optimistic that this global but also an australian spotlight particularly on sexual harassment and will be the catalyst for real she 
jenkins referenced different research projects that examined experiences for women in a of australian 
all show alarmingly high rates of sexual harassment in the workplace and the community at she 
is happening at the moment is it has become a talking point for people who really understand what experiences for women 
as the research it usually 
the people who interview the people who interview 
we look at the data around gender and we learn some 
the bureau of statistics released data from the personal safety 
one domestic 
you read about the reading about credits that have more men than 
are fewer women in positions of therefore there are fewer women who abuse 
has been a historical view in australia that sexual assault and harassment happens because men control their ms jenkins 
these situations happen they happen in situations of they happen where speaking up is 
if ever been on probably read 
way professor keltner described it this is just a 
said women gaining power was a not a 
the weinstein tide will subside only when it has dredged up the last of these abuses of power and we get to a point where a good time to be someone who identifies as any 
need to move from big villains to the small everyday things that lead to this environment where we tolerate sexual ms jenkins 
hope is not that we start catching people in but in the everyday experience we just reduce the prevalence of sexual harassment so not part of the workplace experience for

through the channels on your tv on any given night and see a lot of a fair amount of but not a hell of a lot for people who identify as either male or representation is pretty much 
on the among indie youtube series and lgbt fandoms on change has been a new wave of creators waiting for mainstream entertainment to catch up to the realities of gender just making it and kaitlyn alexander is at the 
is the mastermind behind a web series they both created and star it centres on a bisexual artist who enters into a sham marriage to keep their new roommate in the instantly with lgbt inside jokes and characters that are too awkward not to 
just saw this gap in i was not seeing people like me represented so why i just start doing somebody has to start alexander told buzzfeed just wanted to create a series where somebody can be a romantic lead or at the and not a 
says characters without a fixed gender are entities like and often a it took until for mainstream tv to get its first character in taylor mason on also own character lafontaine from the lesbian vampire web series recently made into a 
if you need proof that representation it get more poignant than alexander realized their own identity while playing 
in the second season of

sat down and i started reading and i was oh can be used as a singular and then like five minutes later in the mirror and they look nice that fits for really 
became a breakout hit and developed a ravenous fanbase of queer viewers who finally got to see characters they related and just as the series became a safe space for filming it was a safe space for probably the only reason that i know who i am they part of that has changed my 
they credit the fans giving them both an audience and the confidence to make it was also the fans who crowdfunded second season into and to that just proves people are hungry to see the full lgbt spectrum come to life on 
one of the few faces in alexander said they often get messages from other people saying they know the identity existed until they saw why presenting people as out characters means so much to 
is important because it gives people opportunities to see themselves in which is it can make you feel like not and super they even received messages from people saying work helped them explain their identities to their really really overwhelming but so expect but pretty said 
now has two seasons under its with a prequel season to but work is far from even with the inroads made in lgbt still improvements to be

bizarre plot lines that really pissed people off 
a lot of them involve ross 
and still get over 
hated on when ross called emily on his wedding and then they thought it would be a good idea to go on the honeymoon and emily gave him another chance after honestly ross was the worst and how he got any girl to even give him a chance is beyond 
add another ross geller his horrible mistrust of rachel when she started working with she and mark were friends who could talk about their shared love of fashion and bond over their jobs and ross became so insanely jealous and mistrusting of assuming that every time they hung out that they were sleeping and when mark left the ross basically told rachel that she have to hang around him anymore if they work and then that awful episode where rachel tried to tell him that having her work life and love life separate is what she wants and he completely ignored her and made her life even ross is just the 
ross constant jealousy over rachel working with mark at was so fucked up and it was borderline emotionally abusive and it was 
season when rachel meets mark again and ross remember him even though it was his ridiculous jealousy of mark that lead to him and rachel breaking 
episodes making the most out of everyone and some episodes he pay his utility bills even when he is back on of our drives me 
father was said to be a drag she did perform in drag but she also lived her daily life as a father was clearly a transgender woman not a drag basically every plot point that dealt with that was as she was constantly made fun of and 
definitely every time i watch an episode featuring i always end up screaming to anyone within funny because and fat people deserve to be treated like human they exist to be the butt of she seemed totally happy when she was she was until chandler made a comment at thanksgiving about her and then she lost the because of what some guy had to not because she wanted 
truly awful ross moment that is hardly ever talked the night before they go to vegas and rachel is alone in the walking around naked and ross sees her through the window and thinks her being naked was a flirty way of inviting him over for 
episode where no one proposes drives me who would just say to someone who is kneeling down with a we have to believe rachel is not that and cleared it up right such a weak storyline and not believable at love the show but definitely an episode i 
ross was devastated about rachel making a career move in paris and crying about never seeing her i sworn they shared a child and why he more upset his 
episode where cousin cassie came to town before monica and wedding and ross wanted to fuck his own what the 
this whole relationship was wrong on so many it started out fucked up with rachel hiring tag over a much more qualified candidate only because she thought her was and then the fact that they were in a secret outrageous and so 
one episode where we found out that ross was first 
lot of stuff on is problematic but seem so bad at the my biggest issue has always been that ross and monica made out when she passed out on his bed in creeped me out when it first aired and still creeps me 
they made ex a punchline because she was gay people are not a punchline they are human beings who have relationships and love their they a running gag or something to poke fun 
drake ramoray fell down an elevator shaft on of our good god none of us saw that 
ross gets mad at joey for liking like you dated her five years and you got her pregnant and you wanna date why do you care if joey such a snot 
hated how carol and susan treated ross like he was a sperm donor rather than biological father from a legitimate a lesbian and i get but susan pushed boundaries quite 
just rewatched the episode where ross insists on firing his male sandy by freddie prinze and it seriously pissed me really going to fire a qualified nanny because a sensitive fuck 
was really the worst when it came to that his son ben play with 
joey had to sleep with the director for a part and the rest of the friends really that bothered by 
taylor 
bothered me that he was but she peed in his pool and her dad went golfing with him it was just then she kissed his i mean monica liked to keep it close to the 
in my top ross when he lied to rachel about annulling their marriage and then tried to convince her to move in so that she would fall in love with him and then be excited to find out they were actually still ross 
after rachel said they should take a break from each and the fact that it that hard for him to bang some girl hours like glad rachel forgive you even after you tried justifying you had every right to stick yo dick in some rando just cause you two on a bye

the lane train keeps on trolling 
finebaum says unlikely that lane kiffin would be a fit at but suggests that kiffin could one day get another job in the 
lane kiffin has a and his plan is fairly simple when you think about do whatever it takes to get florida atlantic as much attention as 
that means trolling alabama and his former nick about his on so be 
placed outside stay rat poison control do not come to 
lane kiffin 
that means promoting as often as so be 
that means tweeting at the lamar jackson or poking his former friends at so be 
is a national treasure 
elizabeth ann lowder 
is nothing that will slow the roll of the lane picking up steam and headed for another headline near after a tweet he sent out over the weekend that referenced the point spread in a win over marshall caused an uproar in las vegas and explained it was all a 
want to cover because of too much rat poison 
lane kiffin 
did it mean he would scale back on social 
big on scaling kiffin 
that the understatement of the 
knew what it was getting when it hired and so far at it has paid not only has fau clinched a bowl the owls have seen an increase in attendance and student engagement at home 
monday students gushed about what kiffin has brought to their i first started coming the only fun part was going to no one would go to the edmond borodic i go to the and we talk about the we are and he has helped the culture 
likes lane freshman nicholas giorgi go to the games to watch 
it any wonder students dressed as kiffin for halloween last 
to the 
elizabeth 
the school bookstore does not sell any the marketing team has come up with ways to play up the interest in head for the season it gave away visors as a nod to 
a few weeks after it made buttons with face and handed them the school realized students could not get enough of and kiffin was perfectly fine being the marketing 
in another brainstorming the marketing team hatched an even bigger what if it could get an actual train to roll through campus to hype up game against it located a company in south florida that rents similar to those that roll around the mall during 
a real live was born complete with a kiffin head in the and kiffin in the the day before the marshall the train rolled around campus for four as students took out their phones to capture photos and 
a national one of the reasons our athletic director and our president hired said blair associate athletic director for external him comes all that as he saw us doing good stuff with his likeness and his he became more and more amenable to doing more and more so when we ran the lane train concept by it was very much go do it if it gets students if it gets them to the game all for 
marketing team also made kiffin heads for students to hold in the kiffin noticed them while watching game 
want to have a program that our fans are excited and at the end of the day you want to have something showing your program where people want to go kiffin the reason for a lot of what we is the it that hard to figure but for some reason a lot of the media figure out why we do 
you want them talking about free when on times and all these free not for for our what you you want to have articles where talking about georgia and fau in the same 
might not be for but most of the publicity is about and most of that publicity happens when he turns on kiffin has a wry sense of and that is one of the biggest reasons his is the best head coach twitter account in college 
just think the whole funny in just how fan reactions are and i think i probably give people stuff to have fun and so they get a kick out of it when i like one of their kiffin all in good i think funny and if i can make people so be somebody joked the other day like when someone breaks up and really mad at the person and they get over it after a while and changes how it i thought that was a funny 
the trolling it has to be 
not near as planned as you kiffin wake up and on way down on my list of when it comes to getting the team ready to win coaches focused on the practice that a lot of times people send stuff to me on my screenshot or send the link to me and i literally push retweet or send and add something to a lot of times a 
kiffin arrived at he had a reputation that preceded but he also took less money to become the head coach and went into the job knowing full well he would not have the same resources he had at usc and 
that has not deterred him from working wonders with the combining concepts he ran at alabama with concepts offensive coordinator kendal briles ran at the result has been one of the most prolific offenses in college ranking in the top in total and red zone 
in conference usa fau sits alone atop the east with a game at louisiana tech on 
been very rewarding on a different and i told the team kiffin younger as a head and just trying to win get to the top of the as i reflect back i think a lot of times doing things for this is i feel like enjoying these players in the locker room so and how excited they are because had 
like why does the poor child thank you so much when he gets something given to him versus the rich completely their how i being in places straight wins straight wins at alabama where kind of not the same so now i truly feel like doing it for for what it gives i know it sounds strange for a coach to say but been surprisingly 
if he needs to grab more attention for his team with a few more so be

the secret to andre dramatic free throw improvement 
has been waiting on this moment for a long the center always knew he could knock down his free but for a variety of reasons the work he put into that part of his professional craft never translated during drummond came into this season shooting percent from the free throw line for his the lowest percentage among active players with at least according to espn stats 
drummond has transformed his ability from the foul he comes into wednesday game against the shooting from the line this 
like night and drummond told been an exciting process for me to see the progress that put in over the the time that countless hours in the gym shooting free working on working on the mental so to see the work that put in come out to light is exciting that finally 
did drummond get to a point where his biggest basketball flaw has become a 
journey started when the reconnected with trainer idan a man who helped him prepare for the nba 
called him up after the drummond told him that i think time to go back to the go back to what got me to where we really put a lot of work i worked out with him for the first half of the really on the conditioning part of game the free and just the whole mental aspect of the 
editorial drummond has career night at center andre drummond has improved dramatically at the foul line this season after working on his shot all and it showed in his performance at the charity stripe friday 
center andre drummond has improved dramatically at the foul line this season after working on his shot all and it showed in his performance at the charity stripe friday 
the the pistons tried several approaches to help drummond get out of his free throw but nothing seemed to at one the team tried virtual and had drummond wear some headgear so that he could visualize being at the but that work after getting the call from who has worked with many nba players during his speaks with pride not only of the work the pair has done but also of decision to search for a different answer to his 
very proud of dre for doing ravin said during a recent telephone is this stuff been doing in the just not working for it might work for it might be great for some but not working for so let me take a moment let me try to find a good 
message to drummond was and the trust that both men established over the years was 
have to scrap all the stuff that been ravin told the stuff that been and a lot because like asking someone to change their their even if they have a messy just something that done for a very long 
pair started working together again during the first week of june in los angeles and stayed in the game consistently for about seven and ravin made it clear he focused on simply fixing poor free throw 
focus make you a better free throw ravin focus was make you a better the free throw shooting was just a byproduct of everything we spend hours working on free we spent thousands of hours on working on becoming a better we doing five star basketball form 
part of the process of long days in the drummond shed about pounds over the according to one thing they do was sit in front of a television screen and watch tape of old the training focused on the then according to the 
find that to be an incredibly archaic way of working with an ravin 
drummond focused on getting his body in better the only people ravin allowed into the gym were mother and one of childhood drummond says he believes he has become even stronger because of all the misses through the 
takes a long ravin said of seeing the for a long it make tons and tons and tons of but then all of a sudden a like know i missed but that felt 
the time came to find a better rhythm with his free throw drummond revealed that one of the ways he relaxed his mind was by taking a deep breath before he started taking his 
went back to just kind of drummond getting myself back to a good mental psyche to feel good at the 
being more which only makes it better for our team so just a great a great going to completely change the dynamic of our team if he continues this so far been 
on pistons center andre 
years one of the things drummond did as part of his throw routine was walk toward center court to try to collect his thoughts before he got to the drummond takes a deep breath as he stares toward the 
just something i do before i shoot the drummond just this brief yoga breath that i do before i shoot the it relaxes my whole body and i feel 
other major visible change in routine is the center is bending his knees more at the line than he ever whatever the key his teammates and coaches are ecstatic about the 
a consistent pistons guard just the way he goes up and he approaches the line each and every whether it goes in or just been been confident with his approach to the but he has a consistent just he looks more sound through his so as long as he continues to stay with the same rolling with i believe going to go 
head coach stan van gundy noted after performance from the line in last win over the that teams would no longer be able to use the 
fact that he gets a lift from it lifts everybody pistons veteran he plays with more he plays with more he wants to go on offense when he gets the not avoiding going straight at being more which only makes it better for our team so just a great a great going to completely change the dynamic of our team if he continues this so far been 
reason van gundy seem so upbeat about the future is because seen the results pour in for a while drummond has been knocking down his free throws since before training so as the rest of the league comes to grips with his new the pistons are left to consider how many new options will become van gundy used to have to take drummond out of games to keep other teams from sending him to the he believes he can go to him at any 
of not afraid at all to go to the line tolliver feel like in the past he would kind of avoid contact and maybe try to finish plays without getting fouled for good reason because he doing too well from the free throw now different going straight through the he wants to go to the the biggest difference in his and just the way changed his form to decrease he keeps the ball out in front of him and just follows as of right now no reason to change anything up 
who is averaging points and rebounds on the also praised the skill work he did with trainer stanley remy during the second half of the summer in miami as a reason for his nice the young big man has been open about feeling more mature than earlier in his also smart enough to understand there is a lot of interest in his free throw turnaround because of how rare it is for a player to have such a huge discrepancy in percentage from one season to the 
think for me just the mental drummond took the time to really find what keeps me at peace while at the when i found it i kind of stuck with even if i miss a shot i think back to the same things that kept me positive and i shoot it and more times than not been going just been a focus thing and really just sticking to my 
said he is also confident that their work unravel if drummond regresses again and has an off night in the 
literally looked at everyone who said he do that it was ravin his team was give going to have you shoot underhand free now really and seen him make percent of his free seen him make percent of his seen brilliant stuff from him this 
from the mechanical differences in his drummond appears to have found the one thing he was lacking most when he stepped to the line the belief that when he put up his it would go 
is something that he ravin it took him time to get and it was his his his his that helped him get

nfl over the jacksonville defense is ferocious it has allowed nine or fewer points in five of eight games this season that much is for but against an offense that still aims to grind out yards on the ground and have quarterback play the chargers likely need a game full of sustained drives to points could do los angeles will be rested coming off of its 
the rams are playing really good football right now and the development of in sean offense is a great example of coaching at the highest but not going to sell on the seahawks just seattle won the first matchup in and pete carroll has traditionally made strong adjustments in the second half of the season to fix cover

in the two games with starting at quarterback for green nelson has been held to just five receptions on targets for and he has failed to find the end the call sheet has been cut hundley is still showing signs of inexperience in the pocket and the short passing game create fantasy i expect that to change this sunday against a bears defense flying around the field on tape right 
chargers this assumes the league hand out a suspension to jaguars cornerback who was ejected from game against the bengals for think it assuming full pass defense is a bringing pressure up front and locking things down on the back end with those guys in the the jags are allowing a fantasy points per game to quarterbacks and a fantasy points per game to wide downgrading and anybody in the passing game this 
arizona wants to ride peterson with but the seahawks are the defense in the league when it comes to preventing fantasy points to running if seattle can take an early the game script completely takes peterson 
the improbable finish at seattle boosted his stats somewhat in week but with so many washington players we should expect tough sledding for cousins against a formidable minnesota 
look past week for the run which was the last to surrender a touchdown in had three in week playing at i believe the run defense will be a closer facsimile to what it was during the first seven games of the role has ballooned of but this will be tough sledding against the 
dirk the job of the head coach at any level of football is to build the proper team that shows in the attention to fundamentals and discipline that carries over to the the bucs have plenty of talent and made key offseason but at with a team that lacks a true koetter should be held 
dirk the situation with the giants is a huge but ben mcadoo did go last year and the giants have a history of being patient with ray handley got two whole bucs ownership does have such a and i wonder if koetter is the first coach to be let go this tampa bay had extremely high hopes for this and when you promote a guy from offensive coordinator to head coach because you like his relationship with the young in trouble if the quarterback advance 
marvin cincinnati is completely the bengals held on to lewis through an entire success and are now at a down this would be a good time to bring on a head coach who can develop young offensive work with the offensive line and rebuild the offense around and 
ben this holds especially if the giants appear inept in losing at san francisco in week a home loss to the jets would similarly downgrade dirk koetter in but cut him a little slack because has been hurt for a few 
dirk tampa bay entered this season with significant aspirations as winston entered his third pro campaign and the offense profiled as explosive with the additions of and among the team has cratered to as winston deals with a shoulder very little has gone right so far this year in 
in his past three mccown has completed percent of his passes for yards and six he also has rushed for two scores over that for fantasy managers looking for a solid streaming option at the i like mccown against a subpar bucs defense giving up an average of fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks 
darkwa seems to be the clear option in the running game for the reeling and this week they play the who are allowing the most fantasy points per game in the league to running he ran the ball very well early in last loss to the which got out of hand quickly and turned into a negative game script for a team trying to run the not likely to happen against the winless who could obviously beat the giants but likely to blow them 
decker has a nice setup against a cincinnati defense that plays well against outside but is last in dvoa against slot 
just over percent of espn fantasy owners had woods on their rosters coming out of week that percentage is sure to rise after woods put up points against the he has catches over the past four games and now faces 
how about san for he has shown himself to have good athletic leading to rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in three helping to raise his but the matchup is also as the giants have allowed passing touchdowns and more than passing yards in their past five

eagles have the best but is the quarterback the best bill barnwell chooses the major award winners and a few including signing of the year and play of the 
nation reporters go on every team at the halfway picking out best and worst moments and and looking ahead to the rest of the 
reached the midway point of the which means time to start talking about things like the mvp we know you love this and even if you we so in honor of the midseason we polled a panel of espn nfl experts on who they think is the most valuable player so this list should fluctuate tremendously until the end of the season or else the and we hope enjoy following along with us as it 
without further the debut edition of the espn nfl mvp 
panel of experts nominated their top five votes are worth five votes worth votes worth votes worth two and votes worth the top five finishers are highlighted in the following full results can be found at 
city running back received the but did not finish in the top 
total 
case for the quarterback of the team with the best record is almost always a top and at the wentz of the he leads the nfl with touchdown passes against just five and he ranks in the top five in passing passer rating and total heading into the wentz dropped four touchdown passes on the secondary in last win to stamp his and case as 
case against not a strong case against wentz at this but if looking for reasons he might not stay atop this four of the next five games are on the road at the rams and the so things might toughen up around and possible at some point that the absence of left tackle will affect the brilliance with which wentz is operating this see what only in the league in completion percentage not but this was an easy wentz got eight of the 
total 
case for this stop me if heard this but the patriots are and brady is having a monster is a state of and mind is stuck on fifth in completion first in yards per game second in passer fourth in total fourth in yards per with touchdowns and two interceptions you name if about quarterback brady is doing it as well as he ever and doing it without it be an mvp poll without who got one of the other two votes that go to 
case against you have to really nitpick but on pace for touchdown which is but well short of who is on pace for not a great case against brady right the reason and wentz is is basically just that wentz and the eagles have been a little bit better so far than the patriots have long way to go 
total 
case for the start has fizzled as lost three out of four after opening the season but smith is still humming third in completion percentage behind and that sentence sink in for a second in passing first in passer rating and first in per while still throwing only one interception to go with his touchdown smith has brilliantly transitioned along with kansas speedy new weapons to a new style of and the chiefs are leading the afc west because of 
case against had we done this three or four weeks possible smith held the he received no votes and no votes got two votes and brady got numbers in the week victory over the broncos and his qbr performances in losses to pittsburgh and dallas were among his worst of the the chiefs started the season with wins against brady and but lost some tough ones lately to 
case for this is what talking enough with the am i gurley scored a two fourths and a fifth to barely edge out the two quarterbacks tied for he ranks fourth in the league in rushing yards with and has added catches for with seven rushing touchdowns and three receiving touchdowns for a he has been the centerpiece of the offense and a huge part of the reason for quarterback big 
case against quarterbacks do tend to win this and the three in front of gurley on this list all have strong and gurley does rank second in the league in total yards from scrimmage behind kansas by the got the other vote in our 
total 
case for this is a bit of a tough brees is fifth in the league in and the saints are a surprising team of which the he seems to be steering the ship with expected 
case against is he the mvp of his own i the qb almost always but this saints are leaning hard on the running game and a surprisingly strong numbers are but hardly the spectacular ones come to and the team is already one win short of its total from each of the past three 
total 
case for this one is easier to because no one has done more to carry his team so far than wilson until last when the seahawks finally acquired to play left wilson had been playing behind usual makeshift offensive line and making magic second in the league in passing yards per has percent of his yards and has saved the team with comebacks against san francisco and 
case against other than the yards and his numbers rate with the quarterbacks higher on this and record or even new that does matter in mvp

more secure alternatives to social security lawmakers in the are looking the senate commerce committee questioned yahoo ceo marissa verizon chief privacy officer karen zacharia and both the current and former ceos of equifax on how to protect consumers against major data the consensus was that social security numbers have got to 
out the entrust datacard president and ceo todd wilkinson offered some context and insight about why the should indeed move away from social security numbers a step that the witnesses unanimously agreed was necessary if not wholly sufficient to protect consumers moving in light of the 
million insecure identities are now forever at and they have limited ability to protect wilkinson key question for this committee to consider what do we do now given these identities are forever 
security numbers are a privacy while a consumer who gets hacked can replace credit card numbers and other account a social security number is relatively linked to a real identity throughout a in the wilkinson and many of the senators present argued that the needs to move to a dynamic system of personal one designed with digital security in mind a stark contrast with an inflexible legacy system that dates back to the 
combination of digital is the right former equifax ceo richard smith said when asked about such a 
times throughout the infraestrutura de chaves públicas system of citizen ids through digital certificates came up as a potential model for the as it moves in this a certificate lasts for three years at maximum and can be used to issue a digital signature much like written signatures are used unlike its counterpart in the these identity accounts can be revoked and reissued easily through an established national

quake on an oscilloscope 
back to 
rendered on a hitachi 
summary of some problems i faced when tinkering with quake to get it play nicely on an 
seeing some cool clips like mushroom and of course playing quake on a scope seemed like a great it ticks all the marks that make me realtime rendered and open 
i wrote simple in youscope rendered cleanly in it after i added some phosphorus decay simulation so that longer lines are rendered so far so 
of an oscilloscope is pretty two voltages specify the horizontal and vertical position of the so by varying these as a function of time you can draw basically you output a set of points with coordinates in range view it in on the oscilloscope and your 
a line segment is linearly interpolating between two points during some time important to keep the drawing speed constant between lines of different lengths because otherwise end up having lines with varying according to great page by jed you actually need to calculate the length of the line to keep the intensities at bay since an approximation will be enough because of the gamma curve of the i went with the correct solution 
order to line draw line segments that are not connected you need to move the ray quickly across the screen without actually tracing a visible this can be done by spending more time drawing the visible lines and then scaling the monitor intensity accordingly to hide unwanted 
simple simulator written in 
whipped up a toy where you could draw a single line with a mouse and it would get played back as audio from the then i hooked up system audio output to and verified it looked ok in the scope 
audio for outputting the two voltages is this is what tejeez did in 
is a games are so my audio generation routines better be quick why i picked as the audio first i spent a couple of nights hacking with the steinberg asio but i just get any sound out of finally i resorted to using which worked just fine for my 
youscope recording is a khz audio file and it seems to work great on the catch here is that apparently the soundcard used on the video apply any filtering to the which pretty 
sound cards i own apply a so bandwidth was pretty in practice this means less lines can be drawn per i thought the problem could be solved with a higher sampling rate so i picked the highest number my swissonic easy usb seems like this make any difference in the end as the picture looks almost the same at khz 
stable release of portaudio compile out of the box on i had to manually remove from with a text installing the asio sdk was also 
are two different the darkplaces quake game and the audio interprocess communication is done via a winapi named 
favourite quake has an excellent software renderer i abused to get access to projected scene the engine was patched to save all the triangle edges sent for and then transfer these to a synthesizer process via a named 
geometry extraction phase affect normal and a proper depth buffer is actually required for the last culling stage to 
pipeline on the quake side is basically 
rid of duplicate and unseen line geometry is because the time budget per frame is tight and all time spent on redundant lines is totally wasted 
occluded lines with depth buffer checks is very 
back frustum and precalculated bsp visibility culling are done i also limited the draw distance by discarding all triangles whose all vertices were far enough from the 
cull the duplicates a of the standard library is the indices of the triangle edges are saved in packed in a single the lower index being the set is cleared between each so the same line could still be drawn twice or more if the same vertices are stored in different before saving a line for its indices in the mesh are checked against the and discarded if already saved this 
the end of each frame all saved lines are checked against the depth buffer of the rendered if a line lies completely behind the depth it can be safely discarded because it be this happens if behind a wall or these checks must be done after all draw calls are processed since geometry drawn in a i implemented this as a series of ten or so depth buffer samples along the line and discarded the line if all of them were this worked well enough but left still some stray peeking behind the corner in some 
line synthesizer audio thread has a queue of lines to be new lines are requested from the quake engine writing an integer to in the main thread if it notices we are running short on stuff to the audio thread consumes this line data on its own pace longer lines take a while to 
audio is synthesized as stereo khz ieee floating point but internally in portaudio converted to signed integers before getting submitted to the asio 
lines per frame are transferred to the synth and if no new data is received on time the latest frame will be shown 
the about samples are allocated to each line depending on the length of the this means the frequencies emitted are very high samples per period is and it seems the audio output is being low pass filtered resulting in silly wobbly 
quality increases as the lines are drawn 
synthesis takes some cpu but most of it is spent on quake depth buffer triangle filling is slow when you do it with just one thread on a modest laptop processor 
total latency is passable and short enough to play comfortably with keyboard and this can be adjusted by tweaking audio synthesis 
be i was quite disappointed by the performance i got out of merely lines on screen usually not even any higher numbers end up being represented as such high frequencies the audio output keep one can increase the time spent on each line but this causes additional latency and the image starts to speeding up the drawing speed allows more stuff per but the quality degrades quickly as can be seen in the comparison image shown 
also some low frequency noise generated in the this is clearly visible when rotating the view quickly and the whole screen moves on the oscilloscope monitor i assume this is some annoying bass boost equalization happening inside the sound you have any ideas what causes please me about 
the cheap sound with another usb sound card the low frequency movement is too bad no proper asio drivers for making it unsuitable for realtime use because of additional

intel to develop discrete hires raja koduri as chief architect senior vp 
intel announced that it had penned a deal with amd to have the latter provide a discrete gpu to be integrated onto a future intel on amd announced that their chief gpu raja was leaving the now today the saga as intel is announcing that they have hired raja koduri to serve as their own gpu chief and task will not be a small with his intel will be developing their own discrete 
from the top and following formal resignation from raja koduri has jumped ship to where he will be serving as a senior vp for the overseeing the new core and visual computing as a chief architect and general intel is tasking raja with significantly expanding their gpu particularly as the company the discrete gpu raja of course has a long history in the gpu space as a leader in gpu serving as the manager of graphics business and in between amd stints serving as the director of graphics architecture on gpu 
in perhaps the only news that can outshine the fact that raja koduri is joining is what he will be doing for as part of intel has announced that they are instituting a new gpu at the the company wants to extend their existing igpu market into new classes of edge and while intel go into much more detail than the fact that they use the term strongly implies that talking about where edge goes with neural network this is a field intel already plays in to some extent with their atom processors on the gpu and their neural compute on the dedicated silicon 
in likely the most exciting part of this news for pc enthusiasts and the tech industry as a is that in aiming at the top of the intel will once again be going back into developing discrete the company has tried this route twice once in the early days with the in the late and again with the aborted in the late however even though these efforts never panned out quite like intel has the company has continued to develop their gpu architecture and the latter embodying the massive parallel compute focused xeon phi 
while intel has products for certain the company have a proper gpu solution once you get beyond their existing which roughly on par with or so discrete which is to say that intel have access to the midrange market or above with their with the hiring of raja and new the company is going to be expanding into full discrete gpus for what the company calls broad range of computing 
between the clear that intel will be going after both the compute and graphics for the former of course is an area where intel has been fighting nvidia for several years now with less success than like to while the latter would be new territory for however very notable that intel is calling these so clear that this just another move by intel to develop a processor ala the xeon 
are at best the technologies complement each other but at the same time nvidia wants server compute and intel wants a piece of the action in the rapid boom in business that nvidia is seeing in the high performance computing and deep learning nvidia has already begun weaning themselves off of intel with technologies such as the nvlink which allows faster and memory transfers between nvidia gpus and the forthcoming ibm meanwhile developing their own gpu would allow intel to further chase developers currently in while in the long run also potentially poaching customers from lucrative consumer and professional graphics 
that going to be surprised if intel develop a true product stack that contains midrange gpus as well something in the vein of polaris and but for the moment the discrete gpu aspect of announcement is focused on given what we typically see in pc gpu release even if intel does develop a complete product i be too surprised if first released gpu was a as clear this is where intel needs to start first to best combat 
broadly this is an interesting shift in direction for and one that arguably indicates that efforts in the gpu space were not the right for the longest intel played very conservatively with its maxing out with the very much more with the haswell generation in intel introduced more powerful and however this was primarily done at the behest of a single customer apple and even to this we see very little oem adoption of higher performance graphics options by the other pc the end result has been that intel has spent the last decade making the kinds of cpus that their customers with just a handful of 
would happily argue that outside of most other pc oems with respect to but at this juncture beside the between strongly kaby soc and now vastly expanded gpu the company if only becoming a major player in the gpu 
taking on nvidia this is going to put perpetual underdog amd into a tough edge over intel for the longest time has been their gpu the zen cpu core has thankfully reworked that balance in the last though amd still quite caught up to intel here on peak the concern here is that the mature pc market has strongly favored duopolies amd and intel for amd and nvidia for gpus so entrance into the discrete gpu space upsets the balance on the and while amd is without a doubt more experienced than intel has the financial and fabrication resources to fight something amd has always which to say that amd is by any means but growing gpu efforts and move to intel has definitely made job 
on the technical side of the big question going forward with efforts is over which gpu architecture intel will use to build their discrete despite their low performance graphics is a very capable architecture in terms of features and in prior to the launch of vega architecture a couple months it was arguably the most advanced pc gpu supporting higher tier graphics features than even pascal so in terms of features is already a very decent base to start 
catch is whether and its successors can efficiently scale out to the levels needed for a architectural scalability is in some respects the unsung hero of gpu architecture as while kind of easy to design a small gpu a lot harder to design an architecture that can scale up to multiple units in a die which to say that only that we as the public have never seen anything bigger than the which is still a relatively small design by gpu 
perhaps the biggest wildcard here is nothing about announcement says when the company wants to launch these for intel wants to design a gpu from scratch under then this would be a year effort and easily be talking about the first such gpu in on the other if this has been an ongoing internal project that started well before raja came on then intel could be a lot given what kind of progress nvidia has made in just the last couple of i can only imagine that intel wants to move and what this may boil down to is a tiered strategy where intel takes both if only to release a big gpu soon to buy time for a new architecture 
directing these raja koduri has in turn taken on a very big role at until graphics lead was tom a fellow and capable but also an individual who was never all that public outside of by raja will be a much more public individual thanks to the combination of expanded gpu svp and the new core and visual computing group that has been created just for 
what intel is seeking to clear why they picked given his experience inside and outside of and more with integrated graphics at both amd and the flip side to that however is that while graphics portfolio boomed under raja during his time at the his most recent amd stint go quite as vega gpu architecture has yet to live up to all of its and while success and failure at this level is never the responsibility of a single intel will certainly be looking to have a better launch than given the immense is definitely something they can 
at the end of the this is just the first step for intel and for by hiring an experienced hand like raja koduri and by announcing that they are getting into discrete intel is very clearly telegraphing their intent to become a major player in the gpu given position as a market leader a logical and given their lack of recent discrete gpu experience also an ambitious so while this move stands to turn the pc gpu market as we know it on its looking forward to seeing just what a intel can do over the coming

the graphql how everything fits together 
been over years since graphql was released as an open source technology by since the community has grown and there are now thousands of companies using graphql in at this graphql summit i had the privilege of giving the opening keynote on the second you can watch the full talk on or read this post to get a quick 
take a look at what graphql is then examine how its main benefits might evolve in the near in particular go over three examples of graphql performance and schema get into 
are main factors that make graphql stand out from all other api 
take a look at three aspects of data fetching that people frequently ask and how graphql improves each of them by taking advantage of the properties 
that while a lot of the functionality going to talk about below is something you can do some of it is aspirational for the if this stuff is as exciting for you as it is for scroll to the bottom to get 
of the first things people always ask about is how do i do caching with my graphql there are some issues that come up when trying to apply regular http caching to 
graphql also brings many new 
can we make caching work well with and how can we take advantage of these new 
we have to decide where the caching functionality should one initial intuition could be that caching logic should be inside the graphql server simple tools like dataloader work well across multiple graphql and putting caching functionality in our server code runs the risk of making our implementation very so we should put it somewhere 
turns out just like in it makes sense to do caching on both sides of the api 
the second your existing caching infrastructure works just for the we need a layer that lives outside your api and is able to do things like caching in a this architecture enables you to pull complexity outside the graphql 
call this component a graphql on the apollo we think this new gateway layer is really and everyone will need one as part of their graphql 
during the week of graphql summit this we apollo the first ever graphql 
i mentioned in the one of the main benefits of graphql is that a huge ecosystem of which all work by leveraging graphql queries and i think functionality like caching should work the same why introducing cache which uses a feature built into the graphql spec called to include cache control information right in the 
our reference easy to add cache control hints right in your 
really excited about how this new cache control spec builds on the main strengths of it enables you to specify information about your data in a and takes advantage of graphql execution to send the relevant cache control hints back to the and it does so in a totally and 
i presented this talk at graphql already posted about working version of cache control for the scala graphql implementation he 
that we can return cache control hints in the graphql we have a clear way to do caching in the each piece of the stack plays its 
cool thing to note is that most people already have a cache in their graphql libraries like apollo client and relay cache your data inside the in future versions of apollo cache control information from the response will be used to automatically expire old data from the just like in other parts of the server describes its the client specifies its data and everything works together 
look at another example of graphql functionality that spans across the 
frontend developers have the capability to work with data in a much more way than with they can ask for exactly what they and skip fields they going to this creates an opportunity to surface detailed performance information and make it actionable in a way never been possible 
could say that graphql is the first api technology with fine grained insights built and not because of a specific tool graphql is legitimately the first time been possible for a frontend developer to get execution and then modify their query to work around 
turns out that with just like with coordination across the whole stack is 
server can provide information as part of the just like it provides cache and the gateway can extract and aggregate that once the gateway component is handling complex functionality that you want to worry about inside your server 
this the primary role of the client is connecting queries with ui this is critical so that you can associate api layer performance with its impact on the for the first you can directly relate the performance of a backend fetch to the ui components it will affect on the 
like the above can be achieved in a way by leveraging response extension the which already has implementations in and defines a way for graphql servers to return timing data for resolvers in a standardized way that any tool can 
a world where all of your graphql tools have access to performance 
apollo you can get performance data in in your or anywhere 
been investigating the interaction between one client and one for our last take a look at how graphql can enable us to modularize our 
of the best parts of graphql is having access to all of your data in one until that has come with a you needed to implement your whole graphql schema as one codebase to be able to query it all in one what if you could have a modular but at the same time retain the benefits of having a single universal graphql 
stitching is a simple graphql makes it easy to combine multiple apis into so you can implement different parts of your schema as independent these services can be deployed written in different or maybe even owned by different 
the screenshot above you can see how one query on a stitched api can combine two independent queries against different in a way totally invisible to the with this approach you can combine graphql schemas like lego 
got a working implementation of this you can try as part of the apollo more in the 
schema stitching concept also works well across the whole we think the new gateway layer will be a really great place to do stitching in the long empowering you to build your schemas using whatever technologies you such as or 
client can join in on the fun just like you can load data from multiple backends with one you can combine data sources on the the new state management capabilities in the recently released client enable you to load data from state and any number of backends in one 
one thing i hope gained from reading this post or watching the that even though graphql tooling today is already so much more potential for the just scratched the surface of what the abstractions and capabilities of graphql can 
like to finish this off with a todo list of just the concepts 
a lot to be done to unlock the full potential of on the apollo working on this as hard as we but no one or organization can do it on their to reach the all going to need to work together and collaboratively build out all of these 
we one thing is graphql has already been a transformative technology for thousands of and just the i wait to see what going to be like to build apps in the next and because it will be 
as pumped about the potential of graphql as we are at consider getting involved in the put together a to get you

caterpillars could save the planet 
escape from a shopping bag triggers an 
scientific research follows a logical with one experiment following up on the findings of every now and serendipity plays a such is the case with a paper just published in which reveals to the world a moth capable of chewing up 
experiment behind the paper was inspired when federica an amateur beekeeper who is also a biologist at cantabria in noticed caterpillars chewing holes through the wax in some of her hives and lapping up the to identify she took some home in a plastic shopping but a few hours she got around to looking at her captives she found the bag was full of holes and the caterpillars were roaming around her 
rounding them she identified them as larvae of the greater wax a pest of bee on considering their escape from their she wondered whether they might somehow be put to work as 
attempts to use living organisms to get rid of plastics have not gone even the most promising a bacterium called takes more than six months to obliterate a film of plastic a mere half millimetre judging by the job they had done on her dr bertocchini suspected caterpillars would perform much better than 
test this she teamed up with paolo bombelli and christopher two biochemists at cambridge dr bombelli and dr howe pointed out like many plastics are held together by methylene bridges that consist of one carbon and two hydrogen with the carbon also linked to two other few organisms have enzymes that can break such which is why these plastics are not normally the team suspected wax moths had cracked the 
of the most persistent constituents of rubbish dumps is which is composed entirely of methylene bridges linked to one so it was on polyethylene that the trio when they put caterpillars onto the sort of film it had taken half a year to deal they found that holes appeared in it within 
closer dr bertocchini and her colleagues discovered that their caterpillars each ate an average of three millimetres every in the plastic a test found that a caterpillar took about hours to consume a milligram of shopping such bags weigh about three so larvae if they spent half their lives consume one in a 
releasing wax moths on the surplus plastic really is sensible is not yet for one it has not been established whether the caterpillars gain nutritional value from the plastics they as well as being able to digest if they do their lives as operatives are likely to be even if they they will need other nutrients to thrive and another question is the composition of their if these turn out to be then there will be little point in pursuing the regardless of the discovery that larvae can eat plastic is even if the moths themselves are not the answer to the problem of plastic some other animal out there might

bitcoin transaction wastes as much electricity as it takes to power an american home for a and legendary coder bram cohen wants to fix and considering he invented the ubiquitous file transfer protocol you should take him 
has just started a new company called that will launch a cryptocurrency based on proofs of time and storage rather than proofs of chia will harness cheap and abundant unused storage space on hard drives to verify its 
idea is to make a better to fix the centralization cohen tells the two main issues he sees in bitcoin are in environmental impact and the instability that arises from the few bitcoin miners with the cheapest access to electricity exerting outsized 
aims to solve 
uses proofs of work to verify the because prohibitively expensive to make a fake blockchain as it have as much work demonstrated as the real but over time given a massive advantage in collecting the incentives for mining bitcoin to those who operate close to electricity and naturally chill air to cool the mining 
instead relies on proofs of space in file which people often already have and can use for no additional it combines this with proofs of time that disarm a wide array of attacks to which proofs of space are 
not the first person to come up with this says but actually implementing requires the kind of advanced computer science he specializes 
inventing torrenting in the early and briefly working on steam for cohen had been at bittorrent building a new protocol for live video but mismanagement on the business side the company to now limping and cohen says need me so while still on the he left in early august to start chia 
network bram 
has teamed up with early bitcoin exchange coo ryan singer and raised a seed round for chia to ramp up cohen say how much it had laughing not sure how much we want to announce right but it was a very hot the goal is do some early sales of chia in with a full launch of its cryptocurrency by the end of though cohen says a stretch 
is a brilliant but it will take more than that to convince people to switch over from bitcoin to he tells me the plan for chia is some smarter things about its legal status and do a bunch of technical fixes that you can do when starting from 
too early to guess how this will all play but at least someone is trying to address the ecological impact of cryptocurrency instead of just complaining about cohen seems excited technically ambitious and a big meaty chunk of work to done enough raising money and now for the real

was going to believe my friend was a troublemaker and i was his weird chinese no one was going to take our word over this it would be even more humiliating for people to know what i was completely and utterly 
was nothing i could even if i told there was nothing they could give back to make me whole inside i was screaming for someone to come save the two of us and take the responsibility out of my but nobody ever showed after more than he packed his dick and

definitely remember something happened that was what do you 
that dude stood in front of my bed with his dick hard and read the bible for

not crazy though that 
it probably i just confirm everything

bill de blasio is a big winner and a lame duck 
in sitting on the gracie mansion asked mayor bill de after all he had accomplished in his first his poll numbers were so he smiled and will be able to judge what people think of me on november he at bloomberg and look at a lot of a lot of turbulence along the way and election day proved in some cases to be very so withhold our final assessment till that 
are now de blasio demolished republican candidate nicole malliotakis by almost with more than million new yorkers to become the first city democrat to win a second term since ed koch in there is no way around give the man his if you go by new york absolutely loves bill de 
fellow particularly in share that feeling is a very different one that will determine how much he can accomplish in the next four the most immediate indicator of how much weight the romp carries will come in the insider race to choose the next speaker of the city typically the bronx and queens democratic county organizations team up and select the council but four years ago they were outflanked by de who joined with boss and newly elected council progressives to help install melissa this time the race is wide open and the field so the backing could be de blasio has kept his preferences at times there have been hints he is leaning toward donovan richards a young councilmember from southern yet the leaders in the contest seem to be two manhattan corey johnson and mark 
his pick of speaker should make it easier for de blasio to advance his legislative with the emphasis on the mayor is now a lame and a bunch of ambitious fellow democrats will now be angling to run for citywide office in one key way for them to raise their profiles will be by fighting with the usually from the votes on land use necessary to advance the affordable housing and homelessness plans will become as will proposals to more tightly regulate the 
quietness before the election is about to be says mitchell a professor of urban policy and planning at law has backfired no incumbent wants to risk giving up a so we have no competition for eight those political tensions will erupt starting with the where and race will combine to create de blasio is going to have a tough time defining the next four because everyone else will be trying to define themselves not just but people like scott stringer and tish james who want his 
the mayoral race was never de blasio had the luxury of playing it safe when it came to laying out what he wants to do in the next four he was actually more specific than was probably the mayor has added units to his affordable housing he has begun an expansion of prekindergarten to he has said he wants to force landlords to retrofit old buildings to make them and he has proposed raising taxes on the rich to pay for subway most of those are worthwhile none of them are particularly new they should also present relatively easy wins compared to three other seemingly intractable reducing increasing educational gains for the poorest and creating a more humane jail has promised that he is going to discontinue the use of cluster sites for the homeless and bring people to neighborhoods where they came and promised to close rikers says joseph a hunter college professor and author of bill de quest to save the soul of new is going to be controversial and expensive to pull both of those also probably going to need to revisit his renewal schools the mayor has spent million so with meager part of a new solution could well include a new schools commissioner carmen fariña took the job only reluctantly four years 
ability to fund that program while also going on a hiring spree across just about every city agency is indicative of probably the biggest factor underlying his big the city is not just safer but flush with steady national economic the global trend toward and the tailwinds of the bloomberg years have swollen municipal the success in converting progressive values into policy was made significantly easier by the yet there are financial warning tax revenue growth is not keeping pace with the city expense budget says kathy president of the partnership for new york a major business things are going you can get away with a lot that you when things are going the republican tax plan now being debated in washington could cost the city fear is that the reversal of state and local taxes and the general federal withdrawal of financial support for infrastructure and health care is going to threaten new wylde question if we start getting how will de blasio 
de campaign focus was closing the his speech last was a variation on that making new york the fairest city of them the local issues and values he emphasized in that cause including equal pay for support for broad and tax hikes for the wealthy all have national and de blasio shy about making the connection new york city sends a message to the white you take on new york values and he to loud hometown will fight the mayor stumbled when he tried to become a national player in his first but he sees his resounding on a night when democrats reasserted themselves across the as an invitation back into the conversation in closer to try to leverage his landslide to push andrew cuomo to the left as the governor ramps up his own reelection that strategy has bought de blasio plenty of headaches in the this time hoping it yields more money to repair new crumbling 
city gone four years without suffering a major natural massive terrorist or drastic economic extending the streak through would be good for but the laws of political physics almost demand that bill de blasio is in for a true one that will be a great deal more stressful than the electoral challenge he just think anyone walks in the door fully formed to be mayor of new york you have to learn on the he told me two months good news about that from my perspective is the more you do it the more it makes a good because reelection landslide was a and the goodwill it generated will likely prove to be

the wave has and republicans stop it 
have suffered a series of close losses in special elections in contributing to the broad especially among democrats that donald trump had a kind of supernatural appeal that defied political physics and rendered metrics such as his dismal approval rating 
wave in virginia has dispelled that particular form of magical trump is a deeply unpopular and his party is in serious danger of losing control of the many of its and conceivably even the 
be virginia has unique demographic qualities that may have enhanced the power of the it is a racially diverse state with a high proportion of but there are many house republicans from districts with similar demographic profiles in new new and among other the suburbs alone could offer up enough republican defeats to flip the house in 
is remarkable is that the republican plan to avert this catastrophe is to inflict economic hardship on these very the party has convinced itself that the solution to its unpopularity is to vote through an unpopular plan to combine tax cuts for corporations and rich people with tax increases on a large minority of the middle the highest doses of fiscal pain of the republican plan would be concentrated on voters who live in blue states new new and 
believe regressive tax cuts hold the solution to any problem the economy is too the economy might become slow in the the surplus is too a many of them will convince themselves that the virginia blowout is the more to pass their tax cut opposed to finding some actually popular measures to and maybe there is a certain logic to if they have rented the government for two they might as well get some mileage out of 
there is also a heavy dose of genuine at since democrats have been talking about republican tax cuts benefiting the richest one conservatives have grown so habituated to denying or dismissing this they have failed to wrestle with its when they are committed to transferring resources to one percent of the democrats can stand for the interests of they need to take a radical stance to oppose the gop they can defend the prerogatives of fairly affluent voters who are still getting hurt at the expense of the it is a very favorable 
the there is no sign of any corrective impulse within the republican its voters are too far locked into the bubble of media and unable to grasp the need for a course fox news and other conservative media have already shifted the blame onto ed gillespie and his supposed failure to embrace after gillespie had the of no less a trumpian loyalist than steve its elites can think of no course of action other than to extract as much value as they as quickly as they they are going to face a

one year after the democrats in disarray 
year democrats woke up to find an authoritarian headed for the white house and their party slouching toward 
gop had nominated the most widely reviled presidential candidate in american history a man who suggested a serial sex just a month before election day and voters evicted democrats from the white down things were even more republicans controlled the the and state legislatures two and the gop could unilaterally initiate a constitutional they would paint the judiciary 
obama legacy had mere months to the emerging democratic majority was a wishful the growing racial diversity of the electorate giving progressives a permanent advantage it was just making white voters more despite hillary fondest whites knew what side their bread was buttered on trumpist gop might be a tad but what really mattered to these suburbanites was keeping taxes 
team collapsing tensions were a civil war loomed between hillarybots and bernie or economic populists and or the grassroots and the the party was focusing too much on russia and not enough on pocketbook issues the it was too concerned with appealing to voters or on solidifying its grasp on it was failing to make a necessary pivot to the or to march to the or to break with or to energize nonwhite amid all the and bouts of catatonic there was only one thing all of blue residents could agree dems were in 
a difference a year the first months of the trump era have been terrible for the country but been better for the democratic party than most ever would have 
performance in virginia tuesday was nothing short of a in the face of a republican manufactured controversies over confederate sanctuary and kneeling nfl players not to mention a rain storm that the bluest parts of the democratic gubernatorial candidate ralph northam defeated ed gillespie by a near as of this democrats are expected to overpower gop gerrymandering and reclaim house of delegates a result that most election analysts had thought 
victories suggest that many of the fears were ralph northam centered his campaign on brand economic savaging gillespie a tool of corporate and attacking trump for proposing to federal for health care and education and won the in the united states by more than down virginia elected its and state developments that belie centrist about both and left 
democrats succeeded in turning out nonwhite voters in a election and an at this has historically been the heel of the obama 
says a lot about va exit va exit normal usually midterm years and feature a whiter benefits gop in a big not 
take back the house in democrats will need to build on hillary gains in wealthy while inspiring nonwhite voters to come to the polls at aberrantly high the party on tuesday 
team triumphs in virginia and effortless win in new jersey only confirmed the good news that has been staring democrats in the face for since democrats have maintained a over republicans in generic polls of the congressional in special democrats have consistently punched their in traditionally red

november most democrats presumed their senate caucus was bound to get smaller before it got far from the incumbents in the deep red states of north west and missouri all boast approval on the other side of the republicans have forfeited the advantage of incumbency in made dean heller deeply vulnerable in and somehow managed to give a democrat a fighting chance in

tuesday all these auspicious developments were shadowed by the failure to win any federal special election failure should have been expected the special house elections were fought in districts that the trump administration had deemed safe enough to pluck gop incumbents but that dour disclaimer has fallen

if you told the average progressive one year ago by this time in obamacare would still be around and democrats would be leading the generic ballot by double overperforming in special elections by historic embracing progressivism winning over beating republicans with transgender and socialist candidates all while the trump administration would be consumed by legal problems and legislative impotence i think said progressive would have been

the uncertain future of trumpism without trump 
losses are traumatic and reckonings are confronting election results in virginia and elsewhere would force many republican pols and conservative media to wrestle with the fact that coalition did not appear to hold so not surprising that they have mostly chosen to ignore fox news carried the avoidance a bit providing very little coverage of the virginia gubernatorial election or this 
news has nothing on virginia this instead they are replaying election night 
breitbart whose writers and editors are a bit more willing to admit the possibility that the gop is not a big happy family rolling from victory to there is also a lot of going on today commemorating the first anniversary of election as but some coverage of election day and it predictably echoes the own dismissive tweet from last 
gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what i stand republicans won out of house and with the economy doing record we will continue to even bigger than 
referred to gillespie as and suggested the great trumpian prophet breitbart news steve bannon had privately predicted 
even as bannon publicly voiced support for gillespie and the republican he privately complained about unwillingness to go and to actively embrace the president and as bannon and his allies would tell is when and how gillespie lost 
revisionist take was probably necessary to erase the bad odor of a bannon to the new york just a few days 
closed an enthusiasm gap by rallying around the trump said stephen the former i think the big lesson for tuesday is in trumpism without trump can show the way if the democrats better be very 
candidate who ran a trumpism trump gillespie primary rival corey who had previously claimed to been by the way gillespie was copying his revoked that tacit 
is a repudiation of who bore the stand for and have led us to the greatest r defeat in a generation 
also not to in any way distance himself from trump in his pending campaign against senator tim who has won exactly three times more statewide campaigns in virginia than has 
most obvious problem with this analysis is that the parts of virginia that would presumably be most sensitive to a republican fidelity to donald trump the areas he won in voted for gillespie just as as veteran virginia observer larry sabato 
gillespie did about as well as trump in percentage terms in rural virginia he kept the trump he actually got more votes than the last republican candidate for 
seems more than a little implausible that gillespie was able to win trump country solidly but lost because trump fans in blue parts of the state stayed home out of dismay at their refusal to put on a maga cap and proclaim his undying love for 
obvious explanation that trump supporters want to hear is that it was precisely affinity for the trump message and agenda that doomed him and worse the virginia state gop to a disastrous performance in urban and suburban that a democratic tide appeared in a number of other states yesterday is an indication that trump is a not a for his 
the bruised feelings of true believers in the the failure of trumpism without trump in an actual election is terrible news for republicans hoping that gillespie had found a way to keep their party a poll from the washington just a week before the election suggested that gillespie had threaded the by appealing to white base with harsh themes without alienating suburbanites interested in his had he won or come very it might have reinforced the wisdom of the much broader gop strategy of keeping its white voters entertained with bread and circuses while rewarding traditional republican constituencies with tax and when attacks on big whether this strategy is an accommodation to trumpism or the essence of trumpism had it it certainly would have been a formula for peace in the 
notable dissenter from the emerging party line that gillespie had not been trumpish enough was rnc chair ronna romney who rejected the notion 
did work with the romney mcdaniel said during a fox news absolutely think any candidate should be embracing the president and i think ed 
who simply want to double down on maga must reorient themselves and choose a strategy going they could just rationalize the virginia defeat as happening on difficult the state did vote for obama twice and hrc just last and as own maximum trump supporter jerry falwell all those employees in northern virginia really belong to not to the old also possible that in a state with more white voters and fewer a candidate like gillespie or someone with a harder edge like another tom could still the 
no longer looking and results greatly increase the temptation for the breitbart wing of the gop to limit cooperation with in even on items of common interest like cutting unlikely that loyally emulating or strictly avoiding the cruder habits and prejudices will solve the political absent a real reckoning with how republicans feel about things like white racial dog economic and corporate those issues will be around long after the president is

when will marvel studios win an 
studios may have the golden but that translated into golden an oscar win is just about the only industry accomplishment that eludes the which puts out several blockbusters a not unheard of for a film to find favor with oscar heath ledger earned a posthumous best supporting actor trophy for dark and just last squad gold for best makeup and hairstyling yet marvel has never managed the to account for this losing and does the studio have a chance of breaking it anytime 
seen movies so far in the interconnected marvel cinematic universe that began with with nine oscar nominations earned among to understand how marvel has fared with look at the categories that this company has historically been competitive 
the easiest race for marvel to crack is best visual all but two of the oscar nominations have come in this from the first man last no film has won the best visual effects oscar since which was made well before marvel studios began its mcu and kicked off our current superhero over the last the academy has tended to give the best visual effects trophy to a film that is also nominated for best and since marvel has never penetrated that the studio has lacked the edge to put its films over the finish 
studios managed a best sound editing nomination for the first but the studio figured into that category think this would be a place for its superhero movies to since action films are often nominated in the sound but the sound branch has seemed almost hostile to movies after when lost to dark no superhero movies have been nominated for best sound editing and though films are all when it comes to their tech there is rarely a distinctive entry where the sound design asserts look for any future nominations here unless marvel produces a truly unusual film where sound is a key 
then best makeup and the oscar that somehow managed to win last despite doing to marvel has been nominated just once in this but it was for a film that frankly should have of the where the hair and makeup accomplishments were plentiful and to grand budapest which triumphed primarily for tilda a single transformative if executed can often triumph in this category over a blockbuster that demonstrated far more how films like iron and vie en have won the best makeup and hairstyling oscar for subtly modifying the lead had been up against a best picture contender with even one significantly tweaked it likely would have it triumphed over an unusually weak field in a year where marvel had nothing much to 
the studio count on some nominations for its three entries this of the galaxy i think the latter two films will likely fall short of the best visual effects race this which promises to be crowded with more prestigious contenders shape of runner of the galaxy the best shot at making that final and an even better chance at once again scoring a best makeup and hairstyling the dozens of transformed characters that can boast among them the new hero played by pom and the sovereigns led by elizabeth debicki will likely prove no match for gary incognito performance as winston churchill in the political drama once a single face is all it 
there is hope on the since two of films are uniquely positioned to make headway with the the first is infinity which is biggest movie yet by leaps and the sheer tonnage of superhero and the ability to pull so many disparate characters into crowded action may provide a distinctive reason for the academy to finally recognize what marvel has accomplished over the last decade by finally handing the studio a visual effects 
even better i will come earlier with this which truly does bring elements to the superhero genre have not been seen onscreen has a strong chance of breaking into a category that marvel has never been competitive best costume the costumer ruth carter has helped design a wowser world of wakanda with outfits that simply catnip for cosplayers but could dazzle academy while the costume design trophy often goes to traditional period the last two winners in this fury road beasts and where to find happened to be big studio that bodes well for but is an even better sign for both marvel and both long overdue for

how does susan fiction stack up against all her other 
his introduction to the new susan sontag collected the editor benjamin taylor diagnoses its author with a term coined by anton in her lifetime sontag died of blood cancer in at age she a practitioner of either in her several books of essays or her four but the picture changed with the posthumous publication of two books of journal notebooks and consciousness is harnessed to that presented selections of her private writings from up to essays are necessary reading for an understanding of postwar american intellectual seriousness always pervaded her but they grew more solemn with as her subjects moved to illness and the representation of while her writing on literature shifted toward neglected works of like leonid in the on the other are no less serious and just as essential as the record of a writer and a woman imagining herself into sontag in private is feel she writes in already a tyro on the new york and author of essays that are still required how i know more in the world than 
fiction has meanwhile been in a state of readerly as taylor no one at this late stage is about to confuse her fiction with her major work as an but sontag worked under a european model that allowed a writer to write and whatever of hers we choose to ignore is our american novelists and playwrights are really either journalists or gentlemen sociologists and they are writing the literary equivalent of program sontag wrote in in and she could never be accused of writing program her four novels split into two a pair of experimental works of the benefactor more concerned with portraying consciousness than and a couple of relatively conventional historical novels from the the stories in between these and while i hesitate to call them they are full of optional 
are pieces of which appeared in the volume the most appealing quality is the absence of a uniform of not a simple term when it comes to discussing the author of would be hard to find any reputable critic today who would care to be caught defending an the old antithesis of style versus she wrote in as taylor writes in his sontag an occasional rather than a habitual writer of short turning to the form as certain expressive needs arose that otherwise be in form proves supremely and even science fiction are all 
the volume begins with a work that resembles straight as sontag admitted in her interview with the is a lightly fictionalized account of her teenage encounter with thomas the circumstances of the meeting are the narrator might as well call her and her friend merrill are both sophomores in southern california in the late though at different high they drive in attend concerts at the hollywood and read the same aware that mann is living in exile in pacific looks him up in the phone book and receives an invitation for the pair to come around on a sunday afternoon for against her susan goes the first shock is his resemblance to his own author 
never met anyone who affect being his resemblance to the photograph seemed like a as if he were posing but the picture had not made me see the sparseness of the the whiteness of the the mottled the unpleasantly visible the smallness and amber color of the eyes behind the he sat very erectly and seemed to be very he was in fact 
merrill the engaging with mann on the faust the theme of his next mumbling that never read as the author assumed all young americans must be is overcome by wants to be alone in the first private library ever afraid that eat too many ashamed when he turns the conversation to the students that he conceive of how far away their education was from his the gymnasium in his native the writer in person is inevitably have minded if he talked like a i wanted him to talk like a what i was obscurely starting to mind was that i have put it back he talked like a book 
of the teenager as budding intellectual precedes the account of meeting and as magical as demon reader from earliest thief of pretend conductor of her classical a different sort of magic animates for a trip to this is the sontag we now recognize from her sparkling fragments that see the intellectual was turning when she visited communing in a gnomic way with her childhood china was where her parents conceived her and where her a fur died in when she was no separating the curiosities of the young susan from the in the most important she never got 
diaristic the title works as a collage of life in not unlike renata and builds to the revelation of a late wednesday afternoon i told julia how stupid it would be if she committed she i thought i was two days later she left her apartment again and killed showing me that she mind doing something it sounds cold at but the last page resolves into something the tears in you weep for weep for story way we live collects a chorus of voices speaking of their friends in intensive care units during the early days of the aids was ursula said to that the difference between a story and a painting or a photograph is that in a story you can still but in a painting or a photo you show you can just show him being stephen this is the critic stepping into the fiction with the best sort of 
stories in of the currents of experimental fiction that were going strong in the and the strongest of complaints which relates the uneasy feelings about her membership in an obscure has been interpreted as an allegory for but such a narrow reading discounts its playful borgesian sontag was an avowed fan of donald and his influence is especially in a pastiche of the love life of miss who hears the voices of the ghosts of famous narrates the life of a child in the voices of parents consulting with a doctor in the course of daily visits that accelerate years at a imagines a corporate stiff replacing himself with clones to escape problems of this one poor short life that was allotted any of these stories could fit neatly in anthology of the without you necessarily peg them to susan but you can hear their echoes all around in the fiction of lydia davis and lynne tillman and deb olin and keep ringing as long there are those for whom received forms and straitened ways of being a writer are never

steven soderbergh on and the weinstein scandal 
steven latest the hbo whodunit stars sharon stone as a writer who gets who did the and as in any classically styled murder there are many possible each with their own 
instead of a detective guiding you through the you do it yourself on your wireless by navigating a narrative map that includes supplemental such as news and viewers should i say have a fair degree of control over how they access the for to allow a scene to play through without pause it and go back to an earlier jump forward to something that happens later in the or jump sideways and experience another moment happening is being offered in two the app version goes live today and can be downloaded there will also be a tv debuting in january on been edited into 
spoke to soderbergh in his lower manhattan production office about the process and technique behind this led into a discussion of the evolution of his directing his brief from and the fallout from the harvey weinstein which soderbergh sees as a watershed moment for show 
this storytelling what about it appealed to guess because it fell somewhere between a show and a not a i wanted a fixed i want your choices to alter the decisions or but i did want you to be able to choose whose perspective you were in at a designed 
for it rode this seam between these two i had the amount of control that i require in telling the but at the same it was a way to dive deep into fragmentation in a way that i really able to do 
i correct in assuming that the element is a way to get people to care in a way they might not if it were a straightforward i watch a lot of true crime on when and i started talking about we agreed that something with a murder in the middle of it felt like the best so we culled from a couple of different we made a list of ideas that we felt we could 
the total running time of the if you laid it end to you watched absolutely everything all the all the i think a little over hours of 
like one season of a cable tv a fair amount of material that make the app version that will be in the broadcast linear version that will air on hbo in we shot a lot of in the early versions of the there were a lot more duplicated follow one path and see a and follow another path and see the same but shot somewhat 
sounds like describing the use of voice in literary still some of that in what we ended up but there used to be a lot what i found was that you had to be careful about when you did to prevent a sense of repetition settling in for the 
was it a matter of giving them the same scene from a different perspective or a different was a topic of discussion that was and i think going forward with other projects in this will continued to be ed and i would talk a lot different can we make this are we allowed to change what people said in the are we allowed to change the of the people in the i think you can take the idea much further than we with the subjectivity of a takeaway of a we have two other projects that developing in which that idea is being pushed a lot 
you push it further this think it was a combination of reticence and ed and i both felt that by the time we determined that we probably could do a lot more than we it was a little late to start going back and rewriting really happy with the way the app works and the interface and how it looks and that but in my in terms of taking advantage of what the format can this is a very first run at something that is going to get much more sophisticated and 
guess you have to design it so the viewer can learn who the killer regardless of the path that they that was another big question we 
is there a scenario in which you find out who killed there was a big debate about i think it would be fair to release the app and have it be possible not to the i not let people we tried to do a little bit of sleight of hand to bury that but we had to let it 
you feel more comfortable with an app or a reached a point where it became clear we needed more money for the tech part of this so i proposed to hbo a linear broadcast version of in exchange for enough money to cover these tech and they 
stopped thinking about the broadcast version until finished the app version of the because it took so long for us to finally settle on the then we finished this and somebody reminded in two weeks you have to turn in the linear that it was my kind of forgotten about or i was in denial about i was also concerned that it would feel like i just a less compelling version of the but then i started working on it and i had a lot of material that survive the app be fun to put that stuff back 
got a thing writing now that is running downfield with this whole app format in a really interesting as described i know how you make a linear version of thing the way laid it i just 
you even want very few of the things worked on have been totally even in your first and got some time by the time you get to ten years jumping around in time logical culmination of trends that have been developing in your career for nearly 
but while branching narrative has been around for a long there were two things that needed to happen before you could do something like one was the technological advances that allow you to experience it the way you should experience that means streaming technology advancing to the point where you have this smooth 
have a couple more questions about the technological and aesthetic first got what might be a unique spoiler to stop people who get the app from spoiling it for people rather wait for the tv you see the tv see how i address that 
second how is a video would argue in a very basic way that a completely different thing from a video one of the reasons why i think virtual as a narrative is never going to go beyond the immersion space is because the bedrock of visual storytelling is the reverse if you look into the eyes of the you cannot hold attention for more than you just and the goal of a game is very different than the goal of being told a story why you have the issue of a reverse angle in a video because you need to see yourself playing the 
are points on the where two characters are having a and i know part of what talking but another part never heard of a dot on the timeline that you like to look at this pdf about this thing or you like to watch a flashback or where did that idea come all came in pretty late what we called it was a way to provide more context for a if you felt like you wanted you have the choice of watching that scene or reading that pdf or doing it or not doing it at up to 
was some discussion internally about whether it was too 
you think it attitude gotten used to watching tv now with three scrolling lines of information at the bottom of the screen all the people do not view that stuff the same way that they would have viewed it years 
watching texts and push notifications come to not acknowledge that when watching something on your phone or ipad that there are other things going on around you is to be in my attitude if going to be distracted by let it be 
not uncomfortable with that at least not in the way that some other directors of your generation seem to you mean the 
you jumped over to video early for somebody of your high and pretty soon you were using it and from that point been right on the edge of whatever the available technology always felt the same way about how things are watched and from the girlfriend to not the person to try and stick my finger in this particular dike of where technology is taking us as there are other filmmakers that can and should push back against and i want to protect this other way of doing just not the person to devote myself to a defense of because i all i care about is the story and telling the i care how people ingest 
control i can only control the thing i try to focus on the stuff that i can control and let go of the other 
your ultimate satisfaction and validation lie in how the audience perceives the thing where does it the 
in the shooting and the in solving a that never gets being on set and trying to figure something out and then seeing it when it reveals you see the next shots in an you know exactly what it needs to and in a mad rush to get those shots as quickly as you can that never gets 
guess no coincidence that made multiple movies about i just stupidly realized while i was doing press for how obvious the parallels somebody asked me about and i was i grew up in a suburban subdivision of baton nothing would theoretically connect me to heist movies except for the fact that they are absolutely mini versions of making a 
you talked to hbo about the possibility another season of developing at least one this new one goes a lot deals with a group of characters who are constantly on their phones and communicating with each and so that component is going to be very central to how information is going to be a much more active i narratively for the 
have you learned about your own process over the are there any basic lessons that you can transfer to people reading one thing that you can transfer is seriousness about when i go to speak to a film i talk a lot about i teach the students how to be but i can teach them how to solve problems or at i can give them a list of questions to ask themselves while trying to solve a 
also given the environment in right is that i typically spend the last quarter of whatever talk giving discussing personal how to and why there should be some accepted standard of behavior when you interact with people and how you treat particularly when in a position like that of a which is an incredibly powerful situation to be pregnant with all kinds of opportunity to be 
we talk about it seems particularly relevant right if in a position of you can look at somebody sideways and destroy their you you need to be sensitive to the kind of power that a director has on a what i say to students can view it as just being and i even care if but i am telling if you treat people that will come back to haunt there will be a day where you lose a job to somebody else because of seen it the reverse is also out of is a watershed movie for my career changed as they say in i got that film because casey silver liked me personally and knew that i had a good reputation working with 
the moment we are in right in karmic been this incredible redirection of a certain kind of energy that was being put out by a certain person over a series of and it has now collected and focused itself back on that been stunning to 
not just show a movement to expose predators in the tech the recording the wall street hope is that a real watershed and that it becomes nearly impossible in the future for people to pull this because clear that there is now a willingness for people to all this negative this is like one of those manhole covers that blows up in manhattan every once in a i think any going i really 
i it feels like the catholic church social not just the events but the reactions to it and the deeply interesting to 
about it interests of fascinating about the conversation going particularly around is the extremes of the and then the impact that had on the movie industry in the last to as i was saying to a friend the other there many people who significantly alter the landscape of the movie business harvey is one of the second it was not for the reasons that he been a real clinic in the duality of human and a very stark example of how certain kinds of in two different can be 
an entire spectrum of unacceptable behavior out and i feel like everyone is collectively deciding to publicly recognize it as going to be fascinating about what academy of motion picture arts and does going any form of physical or sexual assault is a very serious potentially a legal but also what about having some kind of i know lots of people who have been abused verbally and what do we do with 
you believe that in order to make memorable you have to be disturbed in some at 
often raised as a defense of roman mel and i believe that at it takes a lot of energy to be an the people i admire most just interested in things that take away from their ability to make the people i really and that met who fit this have a sense of grace about because they know that there is no evolving and there is no wisdom without 
get better if you behave in a way that shuts people you you have all the ideas necessary to solve you sure if you spoke to harvey in his heyday and said to him what i just said to he would believe that he accomplished all that he had of the way he 
like a and i would argue percent of what you could have because of the way you there is a large group of people who are who you want to be in business but who be in business with i know how you view that as being your best or the best version of your but really curious to see going forward what 
that have anything to do with 
go back to why are you sitting here talking to you going to abandon filmmaking and become a four years 
happened to i was a few weeks into my new career or my new i should knowing that it was going to be several years before i would reach a place where i would want anybody to look at anything i was i was aware that the hours required to become just good would take years of applied i was basically ready to do i was taking painting lessons from and having a great time learning talking to and watching him 
then i was the first person to get a hold of the script for and i just i let that pass through my about everything interested i was the first person to see and i gotta do 
was remarkable to watch your process the set of around the i remember you gave an interview about how you preferred to stay further away from the actors so as not to impinge on their but you are right up in their face with the moving around on the like another actor in the a drastic think what i realized actors they can deal with when me and got the they mind that because that is an evolution that has been to go back to the way i a more experience where the camera is a 
was going to ask if it was a but i guess the same it is the same what i love about this technology the ability to do things as quickly as you can think of for the actor to come on the go right into and then not stop until the scene is finished is the ideal way of 
even engage in the digital versus film discussion other than to say regardless of what you think it looks or what the aesthetic differences or pluses and minuses for somebody who works the way i like to i know how you can argue against me having all the footage that i shot that day within an hour of and being able to edit that and knowing instantly what i got or what i when i think of how much better my early work would be if i had that 
the second time said that to last line of that piece about was you holding up your iphone and i had this shit at the beginning of my the movies been a lot you must really think your early work as good as the stuff doing if i were to go back and look at some of the early sure i would 
would argue that i think your career has had three major phases so and they represent alternate methods of problem i have to tell myself something like otherwise i get out of bed in the the first three films i i even start editing until i wrapped just unthinkable to me 
came out the other end of a different i we could never have shot pages of without having done 
was an athletic component to your direction of you were contorting your body into odd was the directorial version of i just had so much more so the second year because built the to have a canvas that big was just a you can really go into stuff when making a people are have to cut too much of a a canvas like that is all about you just keep going deeper and 
keep mentioning painting and do you paint i painted since i quit taking lessons from got a collage working but painting is like i i took it seriously enough to know it would not be a casual for all or if not going to be serious about then do 
not an artist who thinks that if he masters one he can master the great i have it written down i think it was probably some he possibly true that everybody does have a novel in and probably a very good place for

the supreme court permits the execution of a man who does not recall his crime 
ailing alabaman has been on death row since 
new 
may be simply my educational john roberts said at the supreme court last but the reasoning behind the case against gerrymandering seemed to be this comment from chief who holds two degrees from had a tinge of false the mathematics of gerrymandering brain but justices are often pressed into roles for which law school did not prepare and to name a no surprise that they sometimes get the facts as a recent propublica study or come to questionable 
when it comes to their gravest capital punishment where nine people in robes have the last word on whether someone lives or dies at the hand of the justices are sometimes called upon to moonlight in an even more fraught in v a case involving an ailing convicted murderer and stroke survivor who no longer remembers his the justices confronted questions perhaps better suited for moral what is the purpose of does failing memory affect at what point along the path of a cognitive decline does punishment cease to serve its become an injustice 
unanimity of supreme on november to clear the way for vernon execution was not a sign that the justices agreed on answers to these the vote was a of their view of a law congress passed two decades ago making capital punishment swifter and surer to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of in unsigned the supreme court cited its ruling in that aedpa permits a federal court to nullify a state decision in a capital case only when the latter is lacking in that there is no for a nearly impossible hurdle for a man on death row to it is not enough for a defendant to show even for the federal court to reconsider his he must show that there is no chance the trial court made the right 
that heavy the eleventh circuit court of appeals blocked mr execution in citing the testimony of medical the eleventh circuit found that of mr brain have essentially died as a result of his vascular injury in his brain has rendered mr madison slurred his impaired his vision and left him unable to walk most the strokes have damaged mr diagnosed with both dementia and mr madison could not recall the time years ago when he shot a police officer at never went around killing he told the 
light of this pronounced decline in his physical and mental the eleventh circuit ruled that the state court fundamentally erred in determining the facts and applying the though state courts are entitled to under the error here is too finding that a man with no memory of what he did wrong has a rational understanding of why he is being put to the eleventh circuit patently 
but all nine supreme court justices there is a their opinion between remembering a crime and understanding that a crime triggered mr comments to his doctors seem to show that he grasps the of the pending that he is being punished for and that alabama seeks for his that evidence may or may not be but it beyond the the justices and the state court gets the benefit of the alabama may put mr madison to 
three this strategy of avoidance has its justice ruth bader ginsburg penned a concurring opinion by justices stephen breyer and sonia noting that executing someone disability leaves him without memory of his commission of a capital is a the justices have never tackled but perhaps a case where aedpa is not a and justice breyer reiterated his wider critique of the death penalty in a solo concurring instead of focusing on how aging and disease may limit the scope of capital he believe it would be wiser to reconsider the root cause of the constitutionality of the death penalty 
the question of mr continued culpability for a murder he cannot the justices may have fulfilled wishes when it passed aedpa and bill clinton signed but ratifying decision to put a very sick man with large gaps in his memory to death if not puts the supreme court on one the wrong a philosophical debate over personal identity and consider this proposition from derek an oxford philosopher who died on january to be the unwritten dissenting opinion in some convict is now less closely connected to himself at the time of his he deserves less if the connections are very he may deserve

england players plan to donate each to bankrupt samoan rugby union 
players are set to donate part of their match fees towards their samoan counterparts the samoan rugby union was declared 
the saracens prop who comes from a tongan proposed donating at least per player and the daily telegraph understands there is near universal agreement within the who are expected to meet shortly to discuss the england players each receive a match fee which far outweighs the payment to each of the samoans from a match at twickenham on november 
rfu confirmed on wednesday it would donate towards the samoan rugby union as a goodwill 
world tours agreement samoa are entitled to nothing more than expenses from the host 
entertain the samoans at murrayfield on saturday and the scottish rugby union have ruled out making a similar 
which amounts to just two per cent of the near million turnover it is expected to generate from the has been welcomed but far more needs to be done according to dan the head of the pacific rugby players welfare who has also launched a fundraising

though samoa have visited england twice in three england have yet to play a match in the pacific although a date is due to be confirmed after 
when samoa hosted new zealand in they ended up losing as the all travelling costs which the host nation must pay outweighed what they could generate in a country where the minimum wage is an 
the higher profile games is a great pr exercise but it does not change leo 
only have a capacity stadium and we live in a a cost of a ticket at twickenham is higher than the average monthly the only way that we are going to get any change is to have a fairer distribution anything else is not going to 
acknowledges most of the problems are connected to poor governance by the samoan rugby 
he was a leo led a strike threat before their match against england in but little has improved since then with regular reports of financial 
suggest there is a conflict of interest between malielegaoi holding a position as prime minister and chairman of the 
other politicians are banned from holding positions within governing 
situation could be fixed if world rugby pulled their finger leo 
no reason why samoa should be allowed to operate the model it does where the prime minister is also the chairman of the politics should not be involved in rugby is a business and our union is being run by 
just throw money at what is a third world country and expect it to you would be better off flushing that money down the
