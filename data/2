i jumped o my brothers and i fell hard but i did not snuff it oh no if i had snuffed it i would not be here to tell what i have told i came back to life after a long black black gap of what might have been a million years we hear alex moan and then another moan alex and the other a few times suddenly some curtains which have been drawn around another bed in the ward are parted and a nurse hurries to alex hastily buttoning up her uniform she is trailed by a young intern fumbling with his trousers

it had been a wonderful evening and what i needed now to give it the perfect ending was a bit of the old ludwig van music starts 
i woke up the pain and sickness all over me like an animal then i realised what it was the music coming up from the floor was our old friend ludwig van and the dreaded symphony he staggers to the door it is locked he kicks and tugs the door

you took your boots off you put your feet on the table you kicking stinky motherfucker you fuck me up over there ill stick you in a hole in the fuckin you understand go over there and apologize get the fuck out of 
can you feel my eyes on you can you feel me look into your heart can you feel me in the pit of your stomach can you feel me in you in your heart 
normally my prospects of comin back alive from a meeting with nicky were out of a hundred but this time when i heard him say a couple a hundred yards down the road i gave myself 
back home they would have put me in jail for what im doing but out here theyre givin me awards 
for nicky las vegas was the fuckin wild west 
listen to me very carefully there are three ways of doing things around here the right way the wrong way and the way i do it you understand 
hiya thats a lot of money to be counting out in public 
and keep them coming back the longer they play the more they lose in the end we get it all 
tell that fuckin pepe if hes switching stones on us hed better take a fuckin camel 
now notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything somehow somebodys always lookin the other way now look at these guys they look busy right theyre countin money who wants to bother them i mean god forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal meanwhile youre in and youre out 
when you love someone youve gotta trust them theres no other way youve got to give them the key to everything thats yours otherwise whats the point and for a while i believed thats the kind of love i had 
whats he doin he knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours whats the matter with him making all this mess 
im what counts out not your fuckin country clubs or your fuckin tv and what the fuck are you doin on tv 
look at this fuckin beaut they put in now sherbert send you in here to rob me now been fuckin knockin everybodys dick in all night huh you been beatin all the customers tonight motherfucker 
so now on top of everything else i gotta make sure that nobody fucks around with the golden jew 
she was doin pretty good with her lawsuit but before she could start countin her money the boys back home decided to settle the case out of court instead 
i want you to exit this guy off the premises and i want you to exit him off his feet and use his head to open the fuckin door 
whats that you hear you hear a little girl frankie you hear a little girl ace is that a little fuckin what happened to the fuckin tough guy told my friend stick it up his fuckin 
if a guy fuckin tripped over a fuckin banana peel theyd bring me in for it 
it was amateur night and you could tell whoever it was they put the dynamite under the passenger side but what they didnt know what nobody outside the factory knew was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the drivers seat its the only thing that saved my life 
peekaboo you fucks you 
you know i think that youve gotten the wrong impression about me i think in all fairness i should explain to you what it is that i do for instance tomorrow morning ill get up nice and early take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you and uh if you dont have my money for me ill crack your fuckin head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank and just about the time that im comin out of jail hopefully youll be comin out of your coma and guess what ill split your fuckin head open again because im fuckin stupid i dont give a fuck about jail thats my business thats what i do and we know what you do dont we charlie you fuck people out of money and get away with it 
how the fuck can you grin how the fuck could you grin 
bosses i mean theyre smokin their di nobilis and theyre eatin a trippa and fuckin suffritt you know fried pigs guts while if i wanna talk private i gotta go to a fuckin bus stop 
that black book is a bunch of bullshit they got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still al capone 
yeah give yourself a hand right across your fuckin mouth 
whats the matter with you 
while i was tryin to figure out why the guy was sayin what he was sayin nicky just hit him no matter how big a guy might be nicky would take him on you beat nicky with fists he comes back with a bat you beat him with a knife he comes back with a gun and you beat him with a gun you better kill him because hell keep comin back and back until one of you is dead 
got a lot of holes in the desert and a lot of problems are buried in those holes except you gotta do it right i mean you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk otherwise youre talkin about a or minutes of diggin and who knows whos gonna be comin along in that time before you know it you gotta dig a few more holes you could be there all fuckin night 
you call yourself a man you know youre a lyin motherfuckin gambling degenerate prick you know thats what you are two small kids at home i gave you money to pay the fuckin rent and buy groceries put the heat on you know your wife called frankie and told him the fuckin heats off 
take this one and stick it up your sisters hit me again 
me thats why the bosses sent me out here they wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint like these two fuckin over here they were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin grand yeah right im sure 
yeah he had a scheme all right it wasnt very scientific but it worked when he won he collected when he lost he told the bookies to go fuck themselves what were they gonna do muscle nicky nicky was the muscle 
people only know what you tell them 
two little mice fell in a bucket of cream the first mouse gave up and drowned but the second mouse struggled so hard that he churned that cream into butter and he walked out amen they all lift their heads clearly impressed robert turns to frank and smiles

my coalitions phone lines have been flooded with calls from concerned families wondering if this message signifies the end of the world or the advent of the rapture we feel that us policy in this matter wants to be extremely conservative if theres any chance of danger or threat to our way of life perhaps the message and its contents should simply be disregarded 
theyre all primes no way thats a natural phenomenon 
dr arroway you come before us with no evidence no records no artifacts only a story that to put i mildly strains credibility over two trillion dollars was spent hundreds of lives were lost many more may be in jeopardy due to the almost incalculable worldwide psychological impact are you going to sit there and tell us that we should simply take this all on faith

and i think certain older persons like you and your shouldnt be leaching after their students especially when some of them cant even get their own wives pregnant and they certainly shouldnt be running around making slanderous accusations especially when certain young naive peoples mothers are secretaries at the citys biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits and if you want to keep questioning me like this i wont continue without my attorney present 
none of this would have happened if mr mcallister hadnt meddled the way he did he should have just accepted things as they are instead of trying to interfere with destiny you see you cant interfere with destiny thats why its destiny and if you try to interfere the same things going to happen anyway and youll just suffer

i dont doubt their involvement bill but at a low level could the mob change the parade route bill or eliminate the protection for the president could the mob send oswald to russia and get him back could the mob get the fbi the cia and the dallas police to make a mess of the investigation could the mob appoint the warren commission to cover it up could the mob wreck the autopsy could the mob influence the national media to go to sleep and since when has the mob used anything but for hits up close the mob wouldnt have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude assassins need payrolls orders times schedules this was a ambush from start to finish a coup detat with lyndon johnson waiting in the wings 
first we had your charge that the cuban exiles killed the president then the mob then you said the oil billionaires did it then you said the minutemen and the ku klux klan collaborated to do it now your latest theory seems to be that the cia and the fbi and the pentagon and the white house all combined in some elaborate conspiracy to kill john kennedy let me ask you is there anyone besides lee harvey oswald who you think did not conspire to kill the president 
youre just as crazy as your mama goes to show its in the do you have any idea what youre getting into my man you think jack ruby just up and died of cancer in four weeks after he gets a retrial thats some kinda new cancer id say thats a out of business you got the right but the wrong the governments gonna jump all over your head jimbo and go 
i didnt think much about it at the time just bullshit yknow everybody likes to make themselves out to be something more than they are specially in the homosexual underworld but then when they got him i got real scared yknow real scared and thats when i got popped 
at the time of the shooting there seemed to be some commotion i just am unable to describe a flash of light or smoke or something which caused me to feel that something out of the ordinary had occurred there on the embankment 
clay bertrand is clay shaw the guy who used to run the international trade mart 
under the guise of a patriotic nightclub owner out to spare jackie kennedy from having to testify at a trial jack ruby is shown into the underground garage by one of his inside men on the dallas police force and when hes ready oswald is brought out like a sacrificial lamb and nicely disposed of as an enemy of the people by early sunday afternoon the autopsy has been completed on him who grieves for lee harvey oswald buried in a cheap grave under the name no one 
is this off the record in that case let me sum it up for you real quick if i answer that question you keep asking me if i give you the name of the yknow then its bon voyage deano i mean like permanent i mean like a bullet in my head you dig does that help you see my problem a little better youre a mouse fighting a gorilla kennedys dead as that crab meat the governments still breathing you want to line up with a dead man

lets try to be precise then the word does not appear in our orders we have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies as for the nlf they request that their members in the event of capture should maintain silence for hours and then they may talk thus the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished what type of interrogation should we choose the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months 
to know them means to eliminate them consequently the military aspect is secondary to the police method i know we are not fond of this word but it is the only word that indicates exactly the type of work that we must perform we must make the necessary investigations in order to proceed from one vertex to another in the entire pyramid the reason for this work is information the method is interrogation and interrogation becomes a method when conducted in a manner so as to always obtain a result or rather an answer in practice demonstrating a false humanitarianism only leads to the ridiculous and to impotence i am certain that all the units will understand and react accordingly however success does not depend solely on us we need to have the casbah at our disposal we must sift through it and interrogate everyone and here is where we find ourselves hindered by a conspiracy of laws and regulations that continue to be operative as if algiers were a holiday resort and not a battleground we have requested a carte blanche but it is very difficult to obtain therefore it is necessary to find an excuse to legitimize our intervention and make it possible it is necessary to create it ourselves this excuse unless our adversaries will think of it themselves which seems to be what they are doing

as i said the mother to understand it as i understood it hearing it from the mother that is from the of normans mind you have to go back ten years to the time when norman murdered his mother and her lover he was already dangerously disturbed had been ever since his father died his mother was a clinging demanding woman and for years the two of them lived as if there was no one else in the world then she met a man and it seemed to norman she him for this man that pushed him over the thin line and he killed them both matricide is probably the most unbearable crime of all and most unbearable to the son who commit it so he had to erase the crime at least in his own mind he stole her corpse and a weighted coffin was buried he hid the body in the fruit cellar even it to keep it as well as it would keep and that still wasnt enough she was there but she was a corpse so he began to think and speak for her gave her half his life so to speak at times he could be both personalities carry on conversations at other times the took over completely he was never all norman but he was often only mother and because he was so pathologically jealous of her he assumed she was as jealous of him therefore if he felt a strong attraction to any other woman the mother side of him would go wild when norman met your sister he was touched by her and aroused by her he wanted her and this set off his and killed the after the murder norman returned as if from a deep sleep and like a dutiful son covered up all traces of the crime he was convinced his mother had committed

and yet in the midst of our sorrow it should be noted that this death takes place in the shadow of new life the sunrise of a new world a world that our beloved comrade gave his own life to protect and nourish he did not feel that sacrifice a vain or empty one and we will not debate his profound wisdom in these proceedings of my friend i can only say this that of all the souls i have encountered in my travels his was the most human

how it all came down to this only the devil knows retail rodeo was at the corner on my left the motel was down the road to my right i closed my eyes and tried to peer into the future on my left i saw days upon days of lipstick and ticking clocks dirty looks and quiet whisperings and burning secrets that wont ever die away and on my right what could i picture the blue sky the desert earth streching out into the eerie infinity a beautiful never ending nothing 
as a girl you see the world like a giant candy store filled with sweet candy and such but one day you look around and see a prison and youre on death row you wanna run or scream or cry but somethings locking you up are the other folks cows chewing cud till the hour come and their heads roll or are they just keeping quiet like you planning their escape 
if i was a woman id be a slut a lesbian slut 
dear justine because of you ill be quitting the retail rodeo the last two days have been the most days of my life ive not been able to get rid of you in my head i never wanted anything so bad and i have wanted many things id given up long ago on being gotten by someone else and then you came along the idea of being gotten because of circumstance will never get got is the worst feeling ive ever felt and i have felt many bad feelings im sorry i can never see you again justine forgive me for being so weak but that is who i am goodbye holden wurther if for some reason you could change your mind and want to be with me body and soul meet me after work i will be waiting for you at five pm outside chuck echeese if you are not there at five you will never see me in your lifetime 
holden gave me two of his stories to read its like what a story would be i was about a boy who was put upon his mother was cold and selfish and his father wanted him to play football other people didnt get him especially girls then the boy comes to believe no one can ever really know him so he starts actin out drinkin and doin all kinds of drugs at the end the boy kills himself but jumpin over abridge the second story was pretty much the same as the first except at the end the boy kills himself by drinkin a bottle of bug poison 
that day i read the story holden wrote for me it was kinda different from the other one but kinda the same it was about a woman who was put upon whose job was a prison and whose life had lost all meaning other people dont get her especially her husband one day she meets a boy who is also put upon and they fall in love after spending their whole lives not getting got with one look they get eachother completely in the end the boy and the girl run away together in the wilderness never to be heard from again

a persons body is his temple wendy this body is your first and last possession now as your own parents have probably told you in adolescence our bodies tend to betray us thats why in samoa and in other developing nations adolescents are sent out into the woods unarmed and they dont come back until theyve learned a thing or two

hello can you hear me in the back pc 
the way i hear it soze is some kind of butcher no pity 
the first thing i learned on the job know what it was how to spot a murderer lets say you arrest three guys for the same killing put them all in jail overnight the next morning whoever is sleeping is your man if youre guilty you know youre caught you get some rest let your guard down you follow

it was keyser soze agent kujan i mean the devil himself how do you shoot the devil in the back 
and that was how we started mcmanus came to us with the fenster got the hockney supplied the i came through with how to do it so no one got killed but keaton keaton put on the finishing touch a little from the five of us to the nypd 
you tell me agent kujan if i told you the loch ness monster hired me to hit the harbor what would you say 
after after the operation when that poor girl she went in a coma dr towler called me in he told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired and he never looked at the admittance form and he told me to change the form he told me to change the one to a nine or else or else he said he said hed fire me he said id never work again who were these men who were these men i wanted to be a nurse 
i know how you feel i know you dont believe me but i do im going to tell you something i learned when i was your age i had prepared a case mr white asked me how did you do i said ive done my best he said they dont pay you to do your best they pay you to win thats what pays for this office and thats what pays for the pro bono work that we do for the poor and for the kind of law that you want to practice and thats what pays for your clothes and my whiskey and the leisure that we have to sit back and discuss philosophy as were doing tonight were paid to win the case 
you know so much of the time were lost we say please god tell us what is right tell us whats true there is no justice the rich win the poor are powerless we become tired of hearing people lie after a time we become dead a little dead we start thinking of ourselves as victims and we become victims and we become weak and doubt ourselves and doubt our institutions and doubt our beliefs we say for example the law is a sham there is no law i was a fool for having believed there was but today you are the law you are the law and not some book and not the lawyers or the marble statues and the trappings of the court all that they are is symbols of our desire to be just all that they are in effect is a prayer a fervent and a frightened prayer 
you guys you guys youre all the same the doctors at the hospital you its what im going to do for but you screw up its we did the best that we could im dreadfully sorry and people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives 
well maybe you better do that then you know you guys are all the same you dont care who gets hurt youre a bunch of whores youd do anything for a dollar you got no loyalty no nothing youre a bunch of whores

all right sir let me ask you one simple question do you ambassador zorin deny that the ussr has placed and is placing medium and intermediate range missiles and sites in cuba yes or no dont wait for the translation yes or no

those goddamn kennedys are going to destroy this country if we dont do something about this 
we knew it was coming i tell you kenny these brass hats have one big advantage we do what they want us to none of us will be alive to tell em they were wrong 
weve worked up several military scenarios before i ask general taylor to lead us through the various options id like for us to adopt a rule if we are going to strike we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational because once they are i dont think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched 
i have the authority i am the of the united states and i say when we go to 
if the sun rises in the morning it is only because of men of goodwill and thats all there is between us and the devil 
we have heard stories that some among your military men wish for war you are a good man your brother is a good man i assure you there are other good men let us hope the will of good men is enough to counter the terrible strength of this thing which has been put in motion 
for the last fifteen years i have fought here at this table along side your predecessors in the struggle against the soviet gentlemen i do not wish to seem melodramatic but i do wish to impress upon you one observation with all conceivable sincerity a lesson i have learned with bitter tears and great sacrifice the soviet understands only one action it respects only one force 
mr president as of this moment my planes are ready to carry out the air strikes all you have to do is give me the word sir and my boys will get those red bastards 
sleep is for the weak mr president 
jesus i feel like weve caught the jap carriers steaming for pearl harbor 
call me irish but i dont believe in cooler heads prevailing 
mr president the motto i chose for sac is peace is our profession god forbid we find ourselves in a nuclear exchange but if launched those missiles in cuba would kill a lot of americans thats why im being such a pain in the ass about destroying them destroying them immediately hell even mac agrees 
this all this is language a new vocabulary the likes of which the world has never seen this is president kennedy communicating with secretary khruschev 
lets pray appeasement doesnt run in families i fear weakness does
