to understand why the sky is blue we need to consider the nature of sunlight and how it interacts with the gas molecules that make up our atmosphere
sunlight which appears white to the human eye is a mixture of all the colors of the rainbow
for many purposes sunlight can be thought of as an electromagnetic wave that causes the charged particles inside air molecules to oscillate up and down as the sunlight passes through the atmosphere
when this happens the oscillating charges produce electromagnetic radiation at the same frequency as the incoming sunlight but spread over all different directions
this redirecting of incoming sunlight by air molecules is called scattering
